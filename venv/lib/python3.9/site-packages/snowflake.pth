# Install the legacy API into the namespace package.  This is to support the friendly transfer of the PyPI
# `snowflake` name.  This seems to incur the least overhead, but note that it *does* impose an overall Python
# startup overhead of approximately 3-6ms in testing, depending on the Python version.
#
# This shim only needs to be supported for one year from the date of transfer (which is still TBD, but likely
# will occur in Q4CY24).
